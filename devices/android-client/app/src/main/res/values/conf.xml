    This is an example overlay configuration file for the RDFM app.
    To modify the default server address, you can do:

        <string name="default_rdfm_server_address">http://rdfm.example.local:6000/</string>

    Likewise, overlaying the default update check interval can be done similarly:

        <string name="default_update_check_interval_seconds">240</string>

    NOTE: These settings are only used during the app's first startup. To change them afterwards,
    you must delete the existing configuration file.
